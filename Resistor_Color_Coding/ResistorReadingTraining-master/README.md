# Resistor Reading Training
Hello, this is a program that will help you literraly READ resistor color code.
This is easy, the color table is inside the program and you can remember the all colors and attached numbers.
The colors will generate randomly and you must guess the resistance of resistor which should have these colors on it.
Good luck ;D
