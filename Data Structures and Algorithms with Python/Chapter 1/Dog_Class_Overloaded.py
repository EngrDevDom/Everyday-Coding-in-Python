# The Dog Class with Overloaded Addition

class Dog:
    # This is the constructor for the class. It is called whenever a Dog
    # object is created. The reference called "self" is created by Python
    # and made to point to the space for the newly created object. Python
    # does this automatically for us but we have to have "self" as the first
    # parameter to the __init__ method (i.e. the constructor).
    def __init__(self, name, month, day, year, speakText):

        self.year = year
        self.speakText = speakText

    # This is an accessor method that returns the speakText stored in the
    # object. Notice that "self" is a parameter. Every method has "self" as its
    # first parameter. The "self" parameter is a reference to the current
    # object. The current object appears on the left hand side of the dot (i.e.
    # the .) when the method is called.
    def speak(self):
        return self.speakText

    # Here is an accessor method to get the name
    def getName(self):

    # This is another accessor method that uses the birthday information to
    # return a string representing the date.
    def birthDate(self):
        return str(self.month) + "/" + str(self.day) + "/" + str(self.year)

    # This is a mutator method that changes the speakText of the Dog object.

    # When creating the new puppy we don’t know it’s birthday. Pick the
    # first dog’s birthday plus one year. The speakText will be the
    # concatenation of both dog’s text. The dog on the left side of the +
    # operator is the object referenced by the "self" parameter. The
    # "otherDog" parameter is the dog on the right side of the + operator.
